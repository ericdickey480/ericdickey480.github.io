### About
Since my first computer, I found coding and working with data to be challenging, interesting, and full of rabbit holes to explore late into the night with excessive amounts of caffine. What began with making webpages with no particular theme or goal in Notepad has evolved over the years into a career working with complex datasets and solving challenging puzzles layered in lots of datasets! 

With a love for data deep dives and analysis, I persued a graduate degree in Data Science from Bellevue University (2022). My devops has a focus in the following areas:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Wrangling
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning Models

### Work/Projects (IN PROGRESS)
- **Finding Phish in Webpages** – Using machine learning to detect phishing webpages by leveraging a classification model

- **Intelligent Fraud Detection** - Classify a transaction as fraudulent or not using several methods to determine the best algorithm to use

- **FINAL PROJECT 3**

- **Weather Portal** – Python based program that uses an API call to obtain and display weather for a
city or zip code

- **Exploring Cryptocurrency Relationships** – An exploratory data analysis in the relationship
between cryptocurrencies to determine their suitability for machine learning

- **Heart Attack Risk Indicators** – Evaluating the feasibility of medical data for use in a predictive
machine learning model

- **Automation of Analysis for Breast Cancer Imaging Screening** – Building a predictive model for
diagnosis of medical tissue samples

- **Expedia Hotel Recommendations** – Create a recommendation engine which uses machine
learning to suggest hotels to travelers

- **Dodgers Marketing Data** – Create a marketing recommendation solution using machine learning
to determine the best time to run a marketing promotion

- **Covid Data Wrangling** – Evaluate covid related data from several different sources, including flat
files, API, and web scraping
